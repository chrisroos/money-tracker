## Money Tracker

I've played around with various financial software over time and have never been satisfied with what's on offer.  I'm going to use this project to explore what I believe to be missing and see whether I can build something that I want to use.

It's got some [stories](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/290359) and a list of [alternative packages](https://github.com/chrisroos/money-tracker/wiki/Alternatives).  What more could you want.
